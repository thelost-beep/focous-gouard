**FocusGuard** uses local AI to detect your head pose and eye gaze. If you get distracted by scrolling on your phone or nodding off, it gives you a gentle audio nudge to get back to work!

## 🌟 Why You Need This
We all get distracted during long study or work sessions. FocusGuard is built to be ultra-forgiving for actual studying, but strict on distractions:
- **📖 Let's You Study**: Comfortably bow your head to read a book or write notes—the AI knows you are working and won't penalize you!
- **📱 Phone Trap Detection**: Noticed when you're looking sideways or spacing out for too long (35+ second grace period).
- **😴 Sleep Alert**: Wakes you up if your eyes start to close.
- **🔒 Privacy First**: All facial processing happens locally on your device. **No video is ever recorded or sent anywhere.**
